## What is testSQL?
testSQL is an application that is an easy to deploy interactive tuition tool that aids the learning of SQL.

### So why use it?
* Open-source
* Multiple installation options offers different functionality
* Clear and usable interface
* Ability to import any existing SQLite database
* Dynamic questions - meaning the application will _never_ get stale
* Multiple validation checks for the solution allowing a degree of targeted feedback

### What's next?
* An administration panel allowing the creation of 'sessions' that users can join allowing that user's (the student) progress to be tracked by the session leader (the tutor)
* The application will become more modular where removing a file will only remove specific functionality

### Contributions
* I am in the process of re-coding the application into React, see ['here'](https://github.com/JoshuaLicense/react-testsql).
